# Customer Segmentation with KMeans Clustering

**Author**: Jaiveer Sahni  
**Repository**: CustomerSegmentation-KMeansClustering  

This project explores **customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** on a mall customers dataset. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their behavioral and demographic features, which can help businesses with **personalized marketing and decision-making**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Apply **K-Means clustering** on mall customers dataset to identify **distinct customer groups**.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
Common dataset features include:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income`
- `Spending Score`

These are used to cluster customers into meaningful groups.

### ðŸ”Ž Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ cleaning, encoding, and scaling features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ distributions, correlations, and visualizations.  
3. **K-Means Clustering** â€“  
   - Select optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method** / **Silhouette Score**  
   - Fit model and assign labels  
4. **Cluster Profiling** â€“ interpret segments (e.g., high-income spenders, low spenders, young shoppers, etc.)  
5. **Visualization** â€“ scatter plots and centroid visualizations to illustrate clustering results.

### ðŸ“Š Key Outputs & Insights

- **Elbow method** plot for selecting cluster number k

- **Silhouette** score analysis

-**Cluster assignments** for each customer

- **Profiles of clusters** (avg. age, income, spending score)

- **Visualizations** showing segmentation patterns
